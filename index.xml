      <description>One Seat Open is an invitation system for limited seating events.
History This project primarily came from a personal frustration in hosting my own game nights. Most invitation systems at the time were open ended (no wait list support) or were so chock full of ads that I could barely navigate them. At the same time I was also looking for a project with which to learn front end development as I have been mostly focused backed development.</description>

      <description>Software profession with over twenty years experience in software development and three years as an engineering manager. Under graduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics and a graduate degree in Data Intensive Systems.
My current professional interests are in Kotlin, Go, parsers, ray tracers and Blockchain.
See my projects page for a list of my current and previous projects.
 This site was created in Hugo with the Coder theme. I selected Hugo mostly because it uses Go to generate the static content which means zero installed dependencies other than the Hugo binary (which is statically linked).</description>
