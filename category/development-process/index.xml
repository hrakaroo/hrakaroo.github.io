      <title>Start with On-Call</title>
      <link>https://hrakaroo.com/post/start-with-oncall/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hrakaroo.com/post/start-with-oncall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to my earlier post about &lt;a href=&#34;../walking-the-board/&#34;&gt;running a productive and
focused standup&lt;/a&gt;. While I still believe in the
arguments I made in that post, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
necessarily represent a full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;being-on-call-is-exhausting&#34;&gt;Being on-call is exhausting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on-call can be an isolating, exhausting and thankless task.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had on-call shifts where I was woken up multiple times throughout
the night and by morning I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted and cranky. Worse still, the
next night is likely to be more of the same. In these situations the
last thing I want to talk about is how much progress the team has made
on the current project. Instead, I want to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been
getting woken up for, and how the team can help make this waking
nightmare stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;start-the-day-discussing-the-previous-on-call-shift&#34;&gt;Start the day discussing the previous on-call shift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start off each day asking the question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the person on-call get paged, and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is criticially important that you ask this question as early as
possible in the day. If the on-call was bad enough, it may require
halting all project work and diverting everyone to resolving an
ongoing issue. Or maybe the previous shift was so bad that after
giving a hand off, you want to excuse the on-call person so they can
log out and catch up on sleep. Either way, it&amp;rsquo;s important to ask this
question as soon as possible in the day. It&amp;rsquo;s the most important
question you can ask for the health of the team so it should be your
first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If reviewing on-call takes up your full standup it means that your
on-call needs attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-an-answer-for-every-page&#34;&gt;Have an answer for every page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every pagable event needs to fall into one of the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-a-known-issue-for-which-the-team-is-already-working-towards-a-solution&#34;&gt;This is a known issue for which the team is already working towards a solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pages can be mostly ignored as the team is already working on
resolving the underlying issue. Maybe the services are under
provisioned and the team is working on scaling things up. Or maybe
this is a known bug that the team is working on a fix for.  Either way
the expectation is that over the next couple of days the underlying
issue will be resolved. It would be ideal if these pages could be
muted but that is not always possible as it may hide other
issues. Just be honest with yourself and resist the urge to group
pages together which are not actually related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-a-once-in-a-lifetime-event-and-can-be-ignored&#34;&gt;This is a once-in-a-lifetime-event and can be ignored&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These should be pretty rare and what the team defines as &lt;em&gt;lifetime&lt;/em&gt;
should increase over time.  It is fine to start off with lifetime
meaning &amp;ldquo;once a month&amp;rdquo; but this should eventually stretch out to &amp;ldquo;once
a quarter&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;once a year&amp;rdquo;. If you are getting paged weekly
for anything, that is not a once-in-a-lifetime event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-is-a-new-issue-which-needs-to-be-investigated&#34;&gt;This is a new issue which needs to be investigated&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often once-in-a-lifetime issues are promoted to new issues when they
suddenly start happening more often. But regardless, all new issues
should have an investigation issue created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-small-problems-small&#34;&gt;Keep small problems small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of all new issues should take top priority for the
on-call and possibly secondary person. Failing to properly investigate
an issue not only means that the on-call person is likely to get woken
up from it again, but it can also be a missed opportunity to deal with
an issue before it becomes a major incident. As the backpacking
mantra goes, &amp;ldquo;keep small problems small.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;offer-the-person-on-call-a-break&#34;&gt;Offer the person on-call a break&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting woken up multiple nights in a row can be highly disruptive and
ultimately lead to health issues. If the on-call person was woken up
between the hours of 9pm - 9am, it is highly recommend to switch the
primary and secondary rotations for the following 9pm - 9am
shift. Just knowning that the following night they will be able to get
a full night sleep can make the world of difference to the person
getting woken up every hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also offers a &lt;em&gt;motivation&lt;/em&gt; for the secondary to help out as they are
going to be on the hook for the next night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating Simple and Effective Guidelines for Code Reviews</title>
      <link>https://hrakaroo.com/post/code-reviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hrakaroo.com/post/code-reviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/code-review-guidelines/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;
that was written from a speech I gave about how to set the ground
rules for code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following New Relic’s Project Upscale—an innovative reorganization
intended to make our development teams more autonomous—the engineering
organization formed several new teams, one of which was the New Relic
Database (NRDB) team. As the name implies, the NRDB team is
responsible for the development of our events database, which powers
the New Relic Insights tool as well as several other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we formed the NRDB team, it included several senior-level
software engineers. This was a highly skilled and very passionate
group of developers reviewing one another’s pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-passion-turns-toxic&#34;&gt;When passion turns toxic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being passionate about your work is one of New Relic’s core values. In
this case, however, we may have experienced too much of a good thing:
our code reviews soon became collision points, and we increasingly
turned to passive-aggressive communications to settle our differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Comments made during a code review&#34; srcset=&#34;
               /post/code-reviews/code_review_comments_hufa99ebb0136f264897801a39b183de9d_49740_84049b2d423b98396dbb831ea0015e44.webp 400w,

               /post/code-reviews/code_review_comments_hufa99ebb0136f264897801a39b183de9d_49740_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://hrakaroo.com/post/code-reviews/code_review_comments_hufa99ebb0136f264897801a39b183de9d_49740_84049b2d423b98396dbb831ea0015e44.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;700&#34;
               height=&#34;337&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example on the left, the reviewer left the PR in an in-between
state. They didn’t explicitly reject it, but they didn’t approve it
either. In the example on the right, the reviewer made a highly
subjective request, and the author just made the change, but from
their tone you can kind of guess that they didn’t appreciate the
feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the NRDB team’s developers grew increasingly frustrated,
team trust eroded, and several members (myself included) contemplated
switching to other teams. We were in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;refining-our-processand-saving-the-team&#34;&gt;Refining our process—and saving the team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided as a team to take a step back; we resolved to figure out
what was going on, why it was happening, and what we could do to fix
it. Since most of our frustration was tied to our code reviews, we
started by asking a simple question: how could we give one another
more effective and constructive feedback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We answered the question by developing four basic guidelines for code
reviews. We think you’ll find them useful, too, but before we spell
them out, we want to share the full story behind what happened to
divide our team and what was really as stake for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-flawed-approach-to-the-code-review-process&#34;&gt;A flawed approach to the code review process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our challenges were related to the differences between
objective and subjective feedback in our code reviews. Being able to
differentiate clearly between these two types of feedback can be
critical to the success of a code review, and to the effectiveness of
a development team. In too many cases, we weren’t handling subjective
feedback in a constructive manner—in fact, just the opposite was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably aren’t the only ones who struggle with this issue. Many
developers are trained from the start to downplay differences between
the two types of feedback. In fact, students in academic software
engineering programs rarely learn how to give or receive critical
feedback of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to school, this certainly was the case. The computer
science curriculum focused on algorithm analysis, data modeling, and
problem solving. Our instructors treated code review as a functional
quality-assurance task; they rarely presented it as a creative
process. Code review feedback tended to be straightforward: The code
either worked, or it didn’t. Because of this kind of training—or
rather, lack of training— many software engineers still treat all
aspects of code reviews as completely objective activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s useful to contrast this approach with the one employed in an
academic creative writing program. There, instructors conduct
workshops that include training on how to give critical
feedback. Creative writing instructors understand that giving and
receiving critical feedback is an essential part of the creative
process. They also understand, however, that critical feedback can be
harmful and create resentment unless it is handled properly. The goal
is to provide feedback in a positive and constructive way that helps
to hone a writer’s ideas, enhance their creativity, and leave both
parties enriched by the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-struggle-over-subjectivity&#34;&gt;The struggle over subjectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many facets of a code review, however, are not straightforward. In
particular, there are issues that demand subjective assessments for
which there are no “correct” answers. This is where the rigid emphasis
on code review as a totally objective activity, and the failure to
consider the creative nature of software development, can become a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many elements of a modern code review process are now fully
automated. Editors and IDEs will find syntax errors, evaluate Boolean
logic, and warn about infinite loops. As a result, the bugs that
survive are much harder to find, especially when you’re at the end of
the process and are just looking at a code snippet with limited
context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editors and IDEs, however, can’t detect—or prevent developers from
focusing on—subjective issues such as confusing method names,
questionable style preferences, and bad variable formatting. And when
we dislike and disagree with what we find in such cases, we often
forget that these &amp;ldquo;flaws&amp;rdquo; are subjective matters of opinion—not
objective matters of fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach also makes it easy to forget that a debate over
subjective issues during a code review can get emotional and heated
very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Opinions made during code reviews&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://hrakaroo.com/post/code-reviews/code_review_opinions_hufa99ebb0136f264897801a39b183de9d_28768_c152d5f577e6d47239943f9c66eca151.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some teams try to regulate this problem out of existence by creating
style guides that make objective rules out of subjective
preferences. This approach rarely succeeds: software development is
full of subjective choices, and there is no way to cover every
subjective choice that developers may face in the course of project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a team lacks a clear communication channel for subjective
feedback, the problem gets even worse. Reviewers may mix their
subjective and objective comments without acknowledging the
differences; here too, the process can end in resentment, frustration,
and a breakdown in team communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-four-guidelines-for-code-reviews&#34;&gt;Our four guidelines for code reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to the guidelines we developed to govern the
subjective elements of the NRDB team’s code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as a preliminary to our four guidelines, we agreed to define
&lt;em&gt;who is ultimately responsible for the correct execution of any code
changes.&lt;/em&gt; This was important to us because in a subjective debate, the
opinions of the person who has the ultimate responsibility—in other
words, verifying code execution— should carry the most weight. As a
result, we decided that &amp;ldquo;The author of the code change is responsible
for the correct execution of the change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but not all teams work that way. Some teams,
for example, treat the review process as a QA process where the
reviewer is ultimately responsible for verifying correct execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that subjective comments were most often presented as
objective feedback at the pull request stage of the process. As a
result, this is where we focused our code review guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In creating these rules, we laid a foundation for team members to
clearly identify what a code reviewer should look for, and how to give
both subjective and objective feedback. Here are the guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reviewer should identify errors that will cause an issue in production.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s a code review, after all, so the reviewer should identify missing
semicolons, unending loops, or missing error handling. Reviewers
aren’t responsible for finding all such errors (that’s still the
responsibility of the author), but they should be on the lookout for
obvious issues that will break the system if they’re are deployed into
production. Such issues are a valid reason to block the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reviewer should verify that the stated goal of the code change aligns with the changes being made.&lt;/strong&gt;
If the author submits a pull request that says they’re making changes
to the networking code of a service, reviewers should expect that all
of the changes are in and around the service’s networking code. This
seems obvious, but it’s no secret that developers have a tendency to
try to pack in multiple changes in such cases. This isn’t even
necessarily a wrong practice, as long as the changes are mostly
co-located. When you align a code change to its stated goal, however,
you make it easier to determine if the pull request potentially
submits any new bugs. Here, too, we agreed that failing to align the
code change with its stated goal would justify blocking the pull
request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reviewer should verify that any changes align with the team’s coding standards.&lt;/strong&gt;
I’ll cover this more in a bit, but as an example, if the team has
decided that all variables must use camel case, and the reviewer finds
a variable that does not use camel case, they should block the pull
request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reviewer should look for anything they personally disagree with.&lt;/strong&gt;
This guideline addresses any comment which the first three rules do
not cover. We want reviewers to give feedback, even if it’s not
covered by the first three rules. We didn’t want our guidelines to
suppress feedback, which is essential for how we learn from one
another. Because these comments are clearly subjective, however, we
agreed that they do not justify blocking the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove all confusion, we ask that reviewers specifically call out their comments as either blocking or non-blocking; and to add those comments as tags in their reviews. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective comments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blocking: You are missing a semicolon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blocking: This loop never ends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blocking: You are missing some error handling here&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjective comments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Non-blocking: Your method name is not clear enough.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Non-blocking: You should put the open curly brace on the line above.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Non-blocking: You should use camel case for your variable here and not snake case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-within-our-code-review-guidelines&#34;&gt;Working within our code review guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we adopted these guidelines, the team had the most difficulty with
the fourth one. Adopting this meant we had to accept two conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The code our team produced did not need to be uniform.&lt;/strong&gt;
This meant overcoming a trend in our industry that says you should
strive to remove all fingerprints from your code that identifies who
wrote what part. We found the ROI on following this trend was pretty
low, and trying to do so just led us back into the same subjective
debate: If a developer writes code in a manner slightly different than
their peer would, does that mean the code is incorrect? Clearly, we
decided, that wasn’t the objective case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a reviewer adds non-blocking feedback, the author should take the time to consider it.&lt;/strong&gt;
Early on, some team members were concerned that authors would simply
ignore all non-blocking comments, as their code was no longer blocked
by subjective feedback. Our solution, then, was to reiterate that &amp;ldquo;we
trust our teammates.&amp;rdquo; If, as reviewers, we took the time to enter a
comment, we trusted that the author would take the time to read and
consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These both were contentious points, and the team spent a long time
debating them. But ultimately, we found that the only way to work
through these issues successfully is to live with the guidelines and
give them a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sponsoring-a-coding-standard&#34;&gt;Sponsoring a coding standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are a reviewer’s options if they see something which they
passionately feel shouldn’t be in the code, especially if their
concern isn’t an &amp;ldquo;objective&amp;rdquo; rule violation they can block on? For
such concerns, we agreed that a reviewer could choose to sponsor an
addition to the team’s coding standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks, we hold a retrospective meeting where team members
are welcome to suggest changes or additions to our coding
standards. There are two restrictions to this activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We cannot describe coding standards in subjective language.&lt;/strong&gt;
For example, a sponsor can’t say, &amp;ldquo;variables must not be ambiguous,&amp;rdquo;
as ambiguity is subjective. But, the sponsor could add a standard that
states, &amp;ldquo;variables must use Hungarian notation,&amp;rdquo; as this is objective
and easily enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you sponsor a coding standard, you must support it.&lt;/strong&gt;
The sponsor must provide documentation and training as needed. If
there was a plugin or other tool the team needs to installed, the
sponsor is responsible for supporting it. This restriction ensures the
sponsor is passionate about anything they want to add to the team’s
coding standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-respect-and-compromise-in-code-reviews&#34;&gt;Finding respect and compromise in code reviews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After agreeing to these guidelines, we cleared all our existing coding
standards and started over. For the first few weeks it was hard to
break old habits, and we had to remind several team members to add the
blocking and non-blocking tags during their pull request reviews. But
once we got rolling with the new guidelines, we saw a number of
successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, by forcing reviewers to clearly identify those comments that
were subjective, we noticed a change in how reviewers phrased their
comments.Reviewers can no longer demand changes that meet their
preferences; instead, they must request changes politely, and explain
why they’re requesting the change. When we provide more explanation
and context in this manner we create an environment that makes it
easier for teammates to learn from one another. Plus, asking for
changes, rather than demanding them, shows respect and acknowledges
that the code’s author has valid feelings about their work, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also noticed that when a reviewer did write a non-blocking comment
asking for a change, the author typically made the requested change or
came up with a compromise—even though the author had the option of
ignoring the comment. This demonstrates why asking for changes, rather
than demanding them, builds stronger teams: the author feels less
resentful, and the reviewer feels that the author genuinely
appreciated their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve identified a few other terrific benefits from this process. By
limiting the scope of what qualifies as a blocking comment, for
example, we reduced the time it took us to approve and merge changes,
which resulted in greater overall project velocity. We have also
reduced the time required to onboard new new team members and to get
them up to speed with our code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also updated our training materials to reflect our new code
review process: We distribute one page that documents our guidelines,
and another page that documents our coding standards. New team members
now know exactly what they should be looking for and how best to
communicate their suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also expected the number of coding standards to increase greatly as
reviewers sponsored new standards for items they could no longer block
on. At the beginning, we did adopt several new coding standards, but
after an initial burst, the number of new agreements fell off
significantly. We concluded that since reviewers felt that authors
were taking into consideration their subjective feedback, they did not
feel as motivated to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; them to objective constraints based on
their point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;these-guidelines-aid-in-team-autonomy&#34;&gt;These guidelines aid in team autonomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing about these guidelines is that they support
team autonomy; in no way do these guidelines dictate which coding
standards teams should adopt. Teams are free to choose their own style
guides, and they decide how strict they want to to be. These
guidelines simply explain how to define coding standards and how
reviewers should look for and give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come to appreciate the role that a strong and effective
feedback process can have on building team morale, increasing team
trust and communication, and improving development velocity. We
implemented guidelines to strengthen the feedback process and to
address issues that put the process at risk—and so far, I think we’re
getting exactly what we hoped to get from these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking the board</title>
      <link>https://hrakaroo.com/post/walking-the-board/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hrakaroo.com/post/walking-the-board/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the traditional standup format everyone stands in a circle and each
person, in order, gives an update.  The updates follow the Agile
format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What they did yesterday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What their plans are for today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any blockers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of problems with this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;context-switching&#34;&gt;Context Switching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t usually stand in any particular order so the updates from
person to person often jump between the project(s) the team is working
on and hero tasks.  Additionally, if we’ve sized our tasks correctly
often what one person is working from day to day changes. This makes
sense to the person giving the update, but for everyone else, trying
to track actual progress becomes increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-status&#34;&gt;Project Status&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to context switching, it’s nearly impossible tell the overall
project status from this type of update.  Even if you could figure out
how many tickets were closed, without looking at the kanban board it’s
impossible to get even a sense of how far along the project is.  Plus,
this format does nothing to encourage people to actually update the
kanban board, compounding the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-speaking&#34;&gt;Public Speaking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public speaking does not come naturally to everyone, even when
presenting just to the team.  I’m much more relaxed with it now, but
there was a time when this type of setting would cause me enough
stress and I would ignore whatever was being said and just rehearse
what I was going to say.  Then, after I gave my update, I would spend
rest of the standup obsessing over the things I had messed up or
forgotten to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;competition-for-busiest&#34;&gt;Competition for Busiest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without focus, the standup can become a passive competition for who is
the busiest person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a meeting with a customer today to talk over a feature they
want added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; meetings today to talk over features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much got meetings all day long so I&amp;rsquo;m not likely going
to get much else done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds silly, but it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen happen a lot at multiple
companies, especially if people are feeling insecure (imposter
syndrome). It can take the form of lamenting (but really bragging)
about the number of meetings, or making the tasks you completed sound
like herculean efforts. It&amp;rsquo;s pointless and unhealthy for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forced-update&#34;&gt;Forced Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it forces everyone to talk when they may not want to.  There
have been times in my career where my personal life has taken over and
I’ve needed to take some time off.  Be it medical or family
related. At the update I don’t want to go into details about what I’m
dealing with. In fact, I may be at work specifically to take a break
from the other stresses going on.  Perhaps I took off work yesterday
and I may have to leave early today to take care of a personal issue,
but now I&amp;rsquo;m in an unconformable position of either saying &amp;ldquo;I have no
update&amp;rdquo; or, worse, explain that &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got some things going on which I
don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an individual contributor I find this standup format stressful and
as a project lead and manager I find it unhelpful.  Instead I prefer
using the standup time to walk the kanban board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-the-board&#34;&gt;Walking the board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a Jira you can use swim planes to split up your kanban board into
project tasks and hero tasks.  Then starting at the &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt; column, just
go down each column and each owner gives an update for their task.  In
this format there is no initial awkward moment trying to figure out
who should go first. The context switching is much less and the team
can focus on what is being said instead of trying to memorize what
they are going to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt; is often an end state and you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to
re-walk this entire list every time you can either cut a Jira release
after each standup, or create a &lt;strong&gt;Closed&lt;/strong&gt; column and use the standup as
an opportunity to move tasks from &lt;strong&gt;Closed&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-comments&#34;&gt;Closing comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One critique of this format is that it is possible for a team member not
working on a task to feel left out. If they really are attending
meetings all day there is a chance to they haven&amp;rsquo;t picked up any tasks
and therefore won&amp;rsquo;t speak.  So, at the end of the standup ask a quick
question for any closing or final comments.  This is the opportunity
to team members to say &amp;ldquo;I need to leave early today,&amp;rdquo; but I would keep
the focus on today and away from team members trying to justify their
time from yesterday. If there really is a concern about yesterday that
should be brought up directly in their 1:1 with their manager and not
the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a project lead and manager I find walking the board to be
significantly more useful as I can tell exactly the progress of the
project (as I’m looking at the tickets) and I can also be sure that
Jira tickets for the project are up to date. As an individual
contributor I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I have to prepare as much for this
standup and I can just attend and focus on what everyone else is
saying.&lt;/p&gt;
