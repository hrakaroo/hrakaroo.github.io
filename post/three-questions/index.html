      <p>The following is <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/writing-api-three-questions/">blog post</a>
that was written from a speech I presented about questions to consider when writing an API.</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing a functional API is relatively easy, but writing a good one
that’s functional and empowers your users takes planning and
patience. Designing a good API is about creating a sense of clarity
and simplicity—it’s the bridge between your intention and your users.</p>
<p>Like most software development, building an API is a creative process;
it’s impossible to completely define a hard-and-fast set of rules that
will work in all cases. Nevertheless, three key questions—derived from
what I consider the key characteristics of a good API—can serve you
well as functional guideposts as you design and write your API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your API’s usage discoverable?</li>
<li>Is your API composable?</li>
<li>Is your API safe to use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each question.</p>
<h2 id="is-your-apis-usage-discoverable">Is your API’s usage discoverable?</h2>
<p>In his famous book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C">The Design of Everyday
Things</a>,
Don Norman coined the term discoverability. &ldquo;When we interact with a
product,&rdquo; Norman wrote, &ldquo;we need to figure out how to work it. This
means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take doors, for example: We interact with these standard physical
objects every day. Often, based on the presence of affordances like
knobs, handles, and push bars, it’s pretty clear how to open or close
a door. But on occasion, a door’s design will suggest the opposite of
how it actually works, and, as a result, we require instructions
before we can properly use it. Just think of how many times you pulled
a handle that actually needed to be pushed.</p>
<p>When we use a door the wrong way, we feel silly and stupid, but it’s
not our fault. Actually it’s the design that’s bad.</p>
<p>Something similar can happen with a poorly designed API.</p>
<p>Consider the last API you used. How did you learn to use it? Did you
read all the documentation first, or did you just jump right in? Maybe
you weren’t sure about all of the parameters, so you sent in null for
a few values and guessed at others. Did the API throw an error message
when you did something wrong, or did it fail silently without any
feedback?  Did the error message clearly define which parameters were
optional and which were not? Did you just keep plugging away until you
got it right?</p>
<p>This is how most users will learn your API.</p>
<p>Your users are going to learn just enough to bootstrap themselves, and
then they’ll figure the rest out as they go. With this fact in mind,
you can help them along the away by increasing your API’s
discoverability. You can do this through documentation; adhering to
conceptual models; and using concise, symmetrical language.</p>
<h3 id="assume-your-users-wont-read-the-documentationuntil-they-need-to">Assume your users won’t read the documentation—until they need to</h3>
<p>Just because your users won’t read your documentation doesn’t mean
that you don’t need to provide it. You definitely do. But don’t design
your API with the assumption that everyone will read the docs before
they use it.</p>
<p>Some users would rather experiment than look up an answer in the
docs. Every time I use Java’s substring() method, for example, I can
never remember if the second value is an offset or a length, so I just
write a little program to try it out both ways. This is usually
quicker for me, and more fun, than looking up the answer.</p>
<p>In many cases, users who’ve learned to distrust documentation won’t
read the docs anyway, at least not until they get
desperate. Documentation is notorious for being out of date or just
wrong. Now, this obviously isn’t true of all documentation, but think
of how many times you’ve consulted documentation—or a help system or
knowledge base—and found that either it provided answers that were
totally useless, or it didn’t provide any related answers at
all. Plenty of documentation does a poor job of anticipating the
questions users might ask or how they might ask them. Additionally,
even if users have a sense of what task they want to achieve, they may
lack the exact vocabulary or use different terms for that task than
the docs, which can make searching difficult.</p>
<p>You should also provide plenty of examples in your
documentation—because users want them. Typically, examples are the
first things users look for when learning a new API. Only after they
gain a little context will they go look at the rest of the
documentation. Examples are how users come to understand your API as a
whole.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-conceptual-model-of-how-your-api-works">Create a conceptual model of how your API works</h3>
<p>Don Norman explains that a conceptual model is &ldquo;an explanation,
usually highly simplified, of how something works.&rdquo; Conceptual models
are not schematics, and they should relate to other known conceptual
models.</p>
<p>A good example of a conceptual model is the file system structure used
on personal computers. File systems, like those on Mac and Windows
operating systems, were intentionally based on the concept of files
and folders that we were already familiar with in the physical
world. This made it easy for non-technical users to understand and
discover how to copy, store, and retrieve files on their PCs.</p>
<p>Even today, Unix uses this conceptual model of files and folders
anytime a user attaches a device (e.g. a phone or external hard drive)
to an operating system, which has completely eliminated the need for
users to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; a new API every time they attach a device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Objects&rdquo; in object-oriented programming are another example of a
conceptual model. They’re specifically called objects so that we think
of them as self-defining entities. Just as a ball object on the
computer might support a bounce method, as well as other methods like
throw, a ball in real life, through its design, also supports bounce
and throw operations. In data-oriented programming, however, you don’t
get this conceptual model, so you’re more likely to have a bounce
function that will throw an error if you send it anything other than a
ball.</p>
<p>Another example of working within conceptual models is the use of
&ldquo;object&rdquo; in object-oriented programming. In this programming model,
objects represent physical objects from the real world, such as
servers, databases, and load balancers, and developers create
relationships between those objects via APIs.</p>
<h3 id="use-clear-consistent-and-symmetrical-language">Use clear, consistent, and symmetrical language</h3>
<p>In addition to documenting your API, you should also develop and
publish a terminology dictionary for your API—and then use it
consistently. For example, I commonly see APIs use terms like host and
hostName, and account and accountId, almost interchangeably. Forcing
your users to guess what the right call might be, or constantly
changing the language, does not promote discoverability.</p>
<p>Like conceptual models, symmetrical language helps users work with
your API with certain expectations in place. If your language is
symmetrical, an open operation will be balanced with a close, and an
add operation will be balanced with a delete.</p>
<p>In Python, for example, you use pop to remove an element, so the
expectation would be that you’d use push to add an element, as that’s
how it works in most other languages. Instead, Python uses append… and
there’s plenty of Google search results from people confused by this
poor discoverability.</p>
<h2 id="is-your-api-composable">Is your API composable?</h2>
<p>When you build a composable API, you are letting your users select
components of the API and use them in whatever pattern they want.</p>
<p>Small and composable methods are easier to describe and document than
larger methods that contain a long chain of steps and caveats. They’re
also easier to run regression and end-to-end tests against.</p>
<p>Most importantly, though, employing composable components gives your
users the tools they need to build their own workflows with your
API. You can’t predict all your users’ needs, so don’t force them into
one execution pattern. Instead, create composable components and then
use your examples to show how to combine them into larger execution
patterns.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">setName(firstName, lastName)
</code></pre>
<p>vs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">setFirstName(firstName)
setLastName(lastName)
</code></pre>
<p>The second option is more composable than the first, as the second
method allows you to easily update the value for lastName. With the
first method you would first have to fetch the value of firstName so
you could send it back in with the new value for lastName.</p>
<p>The second option is also more extensible, as you can easily add a
method to set the middle name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">setMiddleName(middleName)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the second option is also 100% backwards compatible with
existing code. If you were to update the first method to</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">setName(firstName, middleName, lastName)
</code></pre>
<p>you’d break the existing code.</p>
<p>Both you and your users will undoubtedly enjoy the free backwards
compatibility, as building from smaller, composable components makes
it much easier to extend your API as it grows; and to continue
supporting support old operations alongside new ones.</p>
<h2 id="is-your-api-safe-to-use">Is your API safe to use?</h2>
<p>Ensuring that your API is safe to use—that it won’t behave differently
than users expect or break their workflows— is related to the
discoverability of an API. But safety is so important that I want to
call out the topic separately. When you publish your API, you create a
relationship with your users that should be based on trust and
transparency. Here’s how to make that happen:</p>
<h3 id="practice-the-principle-of-least-astonishment">Practice the principle of least astonishment</h3>
<p>The principle of least astonishment tells us that a component of a
system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to
behave. The behavior should not astonish or surprise users.</p>
<p>The setDate method in GNU’s Coreutils, for example, surprises me every
time I use it because I expect a set method to set a value and not
alter it. If you set the year to any value less than 68, it
automatically adds 2000 to the value; and if you set any value between
68 and 100, it automatically adds 1900. Every time I use this method,
I’m astonished and have to re-read the documentation to make sure I’m
using it correctly.</p>
<h3 id="follow-the-contract">Follow the contract</h3>
<p>Don’t try to interpret what you think your user is trying to do. For
example, if your API expects a number, and the user provides a string,
don’t try to parse a number out of the string. You aren’t doing anyone
any favors: What happens when users enter an empty string: Is that 0
or null?</p>
<p>Design your API so that it’s deterministic and strict.</p>
<h3 id="trust-nothing-and-fail-fast">Trust nothing and fail fast</h3>
<p>Similarly, your API should verify everything that users send, and
immediately fail on errors. More specifically, garbage-in should not
equal garbage-out. Garbage-in should fail. If your users are calling
your methods with incorrect values, they may be in discovery mode,
intentionally testing the boundaries and trying to figure out what is
possible.</p>
<p>Help them understand what’s possible and what isn’t.</p>
<p>Plan to version from the start and aggressively deprecate old versions
If you change the signature or external behavior of your API, version it.</p>
<p>And when you do roll an API’s version forward, dedicate time and
resources to aggressively migrate users. If that’s not possible, try
to rewrite older versions so they proxy to the new
implementation. These steps will help avoid creating technical
debt—which, like financial debt, definitely accrues interest over
time. The longer an outdated version of your API sits around, the more
ingrained it becomes in your user base, and the harder it will be to
move users off of it. Set a migration date, and make it happen.</p>
<p>If you release a version that is likely to change quickly, make that
fact explicit by tagging it as &ldquo;incubating,&rdquo; &ldquo;unstable,&rdquo; or &ldquo;beta.&rdquo;
This helps provide breathing room if you need to turn off old versions
of your API as you release new ones.</p>
<h3 id="separate-your-api-from-your-implementation">Separate your API from your implementation</h3>
<p>Finally, publish your API version separately from its
implementation. The implementation is likely to change faster than the
API, so don’t tie the two together.</p>
<p>When versioning a library, for example, the API and its implementation
are in the same package, so you can’t help but release them at the
same time. But you can at least use semantic versioning to make it
clear which parts are backwards compatible.</p>
<p>For a service, though, you can publish an API separately from its
implementation. In fact, there are plenty of tools, including Apache
Thrift, FlatBuffers, and Swagger, that allow you to write your API
separately. With these tools, you write your spec and then build your
implementation so that it implements the spec.</p>
<h3 id="nail-that-first-impression">Nail that first impression</h3>
<p>Your API is often a user’s first impression of your system. Spend time
on discoverability, composability, and safety to make sure that first
impression is a good one. Proper planning and design is critical to
the effectiveness and success of your API. Taking the time to think
things through will help to make your API a first-class feature—not a
mere afterthought or means to an end.</p>
