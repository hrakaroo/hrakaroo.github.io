      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In July 2019 my friend Tobin and I decided to hike the Loowit trail
which took us all the way around Mount St. Helens for a total distance
of about 34.7 miles.  Both of us are in our 40s but in reasaonable
shape and figured we could go about 10-14 miles a day, meaning it
should take around 3 days.  We also managed to secure two passes to
climb to the top of St. Helens for Aug 2nd which extended our trip by
one day.</p>
<h2 id="the-trip">The trip</h2>
<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h3>
<p>The first challenge we had was figuring out where to enter and which
direction to hike the trail (clock wise or counter clockwise).  Since
there is only one trail up to the top and our passes were only good
for Aug 2nd we had a hard requirement of being near Monitor Ridge on
the night of Aug 1st.  Initially we thought we would enter at ___
and go clockwise on the trail.  However, the <em>night before</em> we realized
that the trailhead we were going to use had been washed out and we
had to quickly come up with a new plan.</p>
<p>The new plan was to park at the Windy Ridge trail head and hike counter
clockwise around the mountain.  Tobin is from Seattle and I'm from Portland
so we met at the 76 gas station, stashed his car in a nearby gravel
parking lot and and just took my car to the trail head.</p>
<p>The trail head is at the end of NF-99, super easy to find and there is
plenty of parking and a flush toilet bathroom. There are also some
interesting informational signs that talk about the eruption and slow
recovery of the area. We were a bit eager to get started so we didn't
linger too long. Ate some sandwitches we had brought, sunscreened up
and headed off.</p>
<p>We weighed our packs and both of us were around 24lbs. (More on
equipment below). Also, Mount St. Helens is well known for not having
much water so each of us was also carring close to three liters.</p>
<h2 id="day-1---122-miles">Day 1 - 12.2 miles</h2>
<h3 id="starting">Starting</h3>
<p>For the first 1.7 miles you are walking a winding
gravel road. It's blocked off from cars and well maintained, albiet a
touch boring.  At the end of the gravel road it's still another 1.2
miles until you actually connect to the Loowit trail.</p>
<p>Since we were going counter clockwise around the mountain we headed
right onto the Loowit trail.  At this point the scenery looks sort
of like rolling hills, with the mountain in the distance.  You can
clearly see where the &ldquo;blow out&rdquo; was but the walking is pretty easy.</p>
<h3 id="loowit-falls">Loowit Falls</h3>
<p>Around a mile along the trail there is a turn out to go see Loowit
Falls.  It's about 0.6 miles off the tail but well worth checking out.
A forest ranger we chatted with said we would probbly see mountain
goats but that turned out to be a lie as we never saw a single goat.
Although you can <em>see</em> the falls, you can't actually get near it and
even getting down to the water is a challenge so it's imporant that
you pack your own water.</p>
<p>Once we were back on the main trail it was another 0.8 miles until
Willow Springs.  Near Willow Springs there was actually water running
across the path and if we had needed water this would have been a
great place to fill up.  It was also the last time we would find water
until we stopped for camp that night.</p>
<h3 id="restricted-zone">Restricted Zone</h3>
<p>After Willow Springs the scenery gets significantly more barren and
rocky. This is also the recovery area so no camping is allowed and
really, it would have been hard to find a good spot to camp had we
wanted. This goes on for 5.4 miles, but the trail is pretty easy to
see and mostly flat.  In a couple of places we did drift slightly off
the trail but thankfully others have erected rock piles that make
getting back on the trail pretty easy.</p>
<h3 id="castle-ridge">Castle Ridge</h3>
<p>As you get close to Castle Ridge the scenery starts to change
dramatically.  The trail gets close to the ridge itself in sections
and it's a steep drop down.  Tobin also recognized Huckleberries so we
stopped at several big patches and ate a fair amount before continuing
on.</p>
<p>From Castle Ridge it's 1.4 miles down to the Toutle River.  The start
of this section is a switch back on a sandy incline that could be
challenging to walk at time.  It took a fair bit of concentration but
it wasn't impossible.  (I would not advise either this section or the
ridge for smaller children.)  After the sandy incline you enter the
forest and continue your switch backs down.  It was here that Tobin
discovered wild Salmonberries within reach of the trail and we again stopped
periodically to enjoy them.</p>
<h3 id="toutle-river">Toutle River</h3>
<p>The last section down to the river itself is a steep climb down a cliff
for which the forest rangers have attached ropes for hikers to use.
Going down backwards with your feet walking down the cliff and hand over
hand it's easy to get down.</p>
<p>The Toutle River was around 5 feet across and we were able to jump across
with some rocks.  The river was, of course, ice cold and we were able to
set up camp and refill our water bottles.  The sandy floor made for
a really plush ground and it was honestly one of the best night sleeps
I've ever had camping.</p>
<p>There were lots of places to set up our tents and when we arrived were
were the only people there, although another group did arrive just
before dusk.</p>
<h2 id="day-2---102-miles">Day 2 - 10.2 miles</h2>
<p>In the morning we packed up, filled our water bottles and used the
ropes on the other side to climb out.  The path to climb out was
easier than the one to climb down and we probably could have managed
it without the rope.</p>
<p>Our goal was to hike down near Monitor Ridge and find a camping spot
and hopefully water nearby.  The other camping group were going around
in a clockwise direction and said they didn't see any water other than
June Lake. So our fall back plan was we could find a camp spot around
the Summit trail, dump our packs and hike down to June Lake for water.</p>
<h3 id="crescent-ridge">Crescent Ridge</h3>
<p>The first 1.7 miles of the day was a brutal uphill climb that takes
you from 3200 ft to 4700 ft.  It's almost entirely in the trees and
not terribly interesting, visually.  Although we did continue to find
Salmonberries and Huckleberries and would stop to enjoy and rest for a
bit.</p>
<p>The next 6.5 miles is really nice and mostly flat although at one point
we did come across another part of the trail that required rapelling down
to the river bed (which was dry) and then using the provided ropes on the
other side for climbing out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the mountain is beautiful and the trail is really nice,
although you do go over an occasional rocky area that, at times, can
be a bit tricky to navigate.</p>
<p>However, once we reached the trail for Summit Route we realized that
&ldquo;finding a camping spot near by&rdquo; was virtually impossible.  The trail
is really cut into a steep mountain side and the flora is pretty thick
on either side of the trail.  We either had to hike back a mile or so
to where there was some flat areas to camp, or hike forward and hope
it flattened out.  Hiking back would have taken us further away from
water so we decided to go forward.</p>
<h3 id="chocolate-falls">Chocolate Falls</h3>
<p>Almost exactly two miles from Sumit Route we got to Chocolate Falls
and decided to make camp there.  There is a nice flat area just before
you cross over the falls, but if you venture a little ways towards the
cliff (and away from the falls) you will find a really nice circular
camping area, complete with a fire pit which we did not use.  However,
being so far off the path was nice as it helped us feel secure about
leaving our stuff there while we hiked to the summit the next day (and
also meant that people walking along the path didn't see/bother us.)</p>
<p>Chocolate Falls is named as such because the water contains a <em>lot</em> of
sediment and takes on a chocolate milk color/consistency.  But there
was water and by straining it through a bandana and our Sawyer squeeze
bag we were able to filter it enough to drink.</p>
<h2 id="day-3---82-miles---the-summit">Day 3 - 8.2 miles - The Summit</h2>
<p>Up until now our weather had been perfect but the this morning it was
raining pretty well.  We had initially thought we would start on our
summit hike at 8am, but the rain was coming down hard enough that we
just stayed in our tents for a couple of hours to see if it would clear.
By 11am we had to make a decision if we were going to go or not.
Eventually we decided to go so we both removed everything from our bags
and only packed some food, water, clothes and our summit permit.</p>
<p>We now had to backtrack the two miles back to the Summit Route, only now
the flora was holding water that instantally transfered to us as we walked
back and by the time we got to the summit path we were pretty soaked.</p>
<h3 id="summit-ridge">Summit Ridge</h3>
<p>This was not an easy hike.  The very start of this path is like a
normal trail but it quickly turns into climbing over volcanic
boulders.  There isn't so much a trail anymore, but the route is
marked by poles which are placed just close enough together that you
can just see the next one.</p>
<p>We passed a couple of people coming down who had gone up very early
that morning and mentioned that the entire top of the mountain was
pretty well fogged in and there was not much to see.  Still, we were
determined and continued up.</p>
<p>The entire hike is about 2.1 miles, but it is very slow going. About
2/3rds of the way up we met with a forest ranger who told us that
&ldquo;there is a crack at the rim and it appears that a section is about to
fall in,&rdquo; so we should stay back several meters from the edge.</p>
<h3 id="pumice-path">Pumice Path</h3>
<p>As hard as the trail was, it was nothing compared to the last half
mile or so which was called the Pumice Path.  With every step we slipped
back probably about a half a step.  This easily doubled the distance we
had to go and made a difficult climb even harder.</p>
<h3 id="the-top">The top</h3>
<p>The good thing about waiting those three hours before leaving camp is that
by the time we did reach the top the clouds were clearing and we could
see all around the mountain.  The unfortunate part is that the clouds
<em>in</em> the crater did not clear so we never really got a good full look
inside, although from time to time we got a couple of good glimpses.</p>
<p>Otherwise the view from the top is really amazing and I'm glad we made
the trip.  We did walk partway around the edge and we did see the
crack the ranger was talking about.  Because of the scale of
everything, looking over the edge didn't seem like a huge drop, but
apparently its something like a 2600 ft drop.</p>
<p>After spending about 30 mins at the top we headed down which gives you
a totally new perspective on just how far you have climbed and how
much on a ridge you really are.</p>
<p>By the time we reached our camp at Chocolate Falls it was getting
dark.  We decided to grab some more water but then ended up just
leaving it in our bottles so we could filter it the next day.</p>
<p>Day 4 - 12.3 miles</p>
<p>The next morning we were awaken by the sounds of runners going down
the trail.  It turns out that there were several races going on that
day, with one of them being a full run around the mountain.</p>
<p>It also turns out that Chocolate Falls does not normally run in the
mornings.  Instead it needs the afternoon sun to melt the snow.  So
it was a good thing we had collected water the night before as it was
totally dry that morning.</p>
<p>It was a 1.2 mile hike to the cut off for June Lake and shortly past
that past a creek that was flowing and allowed us to get more water.
This water was clear and didn't need to be double filtered.  After
that it was 4.8 miles to Pumice Butte.  The hike was really beautiful
and you can see several other mountains in the distance.  We stopped
often for Huckleberries and the very ocasional Salmonberry and to move
off the path at times for runners.</p>
<h3 id="pumice-butte">Pumice Butte</h3>
<p>Several people claim you can get water near Pumice Butte but all the
water we saw was very stagnent and didn't look good at all.  The 1.8
miles of The Plains of Abraham are flat, long and because of the time
of day we were there, very hot.</p>
<p>At the end of the Flats we could have opted to take a short cut back
to the car (and my feet were killing me by this point), or we could
continue on the Loowit trail and complete the full loop.  We opted to
complete the full loop and just before we headed up Windy pass we
crossed a running creek and were able to fill up on water one last
time.</p>
<h3 id="windy-pass">Windy pass</h3>
<p>The climb over Windy pass was harder than I was expecting as you have
a steep climb up, and short jog forward and then a steep switchback
back down.  Also, deceptively, they have put posts that run up to the
left, giving the impression you have to climb much higher than you
actually do.  I'm not sure if this was someones idea of a joke or if
there is another trail up that way.</p>
<p>In any case we made it down and eventually made it back to the spot
where we first started on the Loowit trail.  From there it was 2.5
miles back to the car and by now we were feeling every step of it.
Also the winding gravel road has several false turns where you can
easily fall into thinking that the car is &ldquo;just ahead&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="the-car">The car</h3>
<p>Getting back to the car we changed into clean(er) clothes and headed
back to Tobins car, stopping off at Plaza Jalisco's Mexican resturant
for dinner.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<h4 id="boots">Boots</h4>
<p>Tobin was wearing hiking shoes while I was wearing hiking boots.
Although my boots did better when it was wet, and when we were
climbing over the boulders, I think in the long run wearing hiking
shoes would have been a better call.  They are lighter and since we
were on a trail for a majority of the time I think the boots were,
perhaps, overkill.  And by the last day, expecially that last 2.5
miles, my feet were killing me.  Tobin commented that his feet hurt as
well, but I think the boots were adding to my uncomfort.</p>
<h4 id="socks">Socks</h4>
<p>I should have brought more socks.  In the past when I've hiked for a
couple of days (2-4) I usually bring just two pairs of socks, but for
those hikes I'm often spending a day at one destination or another.
For this hike we were moving every day and it would have been helpful
to simply put on a clean pair of socks every day.  Tobin washed his
out in the river which seems to have worked pretty well, but really I
just think at least one pair of socks a day is the minimum and perhaps
two.</p>
<h4 id="camera">Camera</h4>
<p>Tobin and I both brought cameras with us, but while I just brought my
cell phone (because, hey, it has a camera in it) Tobin brought an
actual digital camera.  But, since I had my phone off for the majority
of the trip, taking a picture meant that I had to stop, take out my
phone, wait for it to turn on, take a picture and then shut it down
and put it away again.  Tobin, on the other hand, had a handy pouch on
his belt and was able to quickly take out his camera to take pictures.
I had sort of thought that digital cameras were a thing of the past
(especialy non SLR ones) but aparently not. I have since found my old
digital camera and will be taking it with me on future trips.</p>
<h4 id="water">Water</h4>
<p>Similar to the camera, Tobin's backpack also enabled him to carry at
least one liter of water where he could easily reach and drink from
it.  Mine was attached to the back of my backpack making it a pain and
often I had to ask Tobin to get my water for me.  As a consequence I
probably drank less than I should have.  I need to either figure out a
better way to hook up a bottle, or get one of those camel packs.</p>
<h4 id="more-space">More space</h4>
<p>I had brought with me some fleece pants and a fleece top and while I
normally think these are great (they are light and water/wind
resistant) they do end up taking up a fair amount of space.  Weight
wasn't really my issue on this trip, but space was.  As it was my bag
was packed really tight which meant extra time packing up in the
morning and trying to get to anything.  Since then I have purchased
things that just take up less space so I can treat my bag as more of a
simple stuff sack.</p>
<h4 id="foldable-chair">Foldable chair</h4>
<p>I have also added to my bag a foldable chair.  Yeah, I could just sit
on stones and trees and the such, but after a long day, and in the
morning, it is nice to be able to sit on a real chair.  They are down
around a pound now so I'm hoping to try this out on my next hike.</p>
<h4 id="sawyer-squeeze-bottles">Sawyer squeeze bottles</h4>
<p>These things are awesome.  When we got home and cleaned it out it was
amazing how brown the water was and how much they filtered things.
They are awesome, I just wanted to point that out.</p>
<h3 id="hike">Hike</h3>
<p>All in all the hike was fanstatic.  We hiked a total of 42.9 miles,
saw some amazing scenery and snacked on wild huckleberries.  I would
absolutely do it again, and would like to climb to the top to see the
summit again, hopefully on a clearer day.</p>
