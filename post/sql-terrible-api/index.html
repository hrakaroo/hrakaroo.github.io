      <h3 id="a-long-time-ago">A long time ago&hellip;</h3>
<p>In 1974 the first relational database was created and along with it a
new user interface language was developed to make it easy to query the
data. This language (or rather sub-language) was called Structured
English Query Language or SEQUEL. SEQUEL would later evolved into SQL
and become the preeminent language for querying relational
databases. In the 45+ years since it&rsquo;s introduction SQL has evolved
slightly but it is still largely similar to the version introduced in
the 70s. What has changed during that time is how we interact with the
database. Today, SQL is used significantly more by applications
querying the database than by end users. This usage pattern has
created its own ecosystem of utilities and libraries which help
applications build SQL queries.  One of the more popular libraries for
building SQL queries in Java is <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/entitymanager/3.5/reference/en/html/querycriteria.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hibernate&rsquo;s Criteria Builder</a>
which uses an annotation pre-processor and a builder pattern to
facilitate building SQL queries.  (Java&rsquo;s Persistence API was based
heavily on Hibernate&rsquo;s Criteria Builder). But, at the end of the day
the builder still generates a basic SQL string which is sent to the
target database, parsed and then executed. Hibernate is just one
example, but there are hundreds of other libraries that exist across
various languages which all seek to provide the same basic
functionality. To provide an API which abstracts away the actual
building of an SQL query.</p>
<p>So why do these all tools exist? Is an SQL query so complicated to
construct that we need libraries and utilities to help us? In general,
no, most SQL queries are relatively straightforward to construct. The
problem is that SQL was designed for humans and not computers. The
inclusion of the word &lsquo;English&rsquo; in the original name was not by
chance, SQL was intended to be similar enough to English that it would
be self descriptive and would only require minimal transformation from
the spoken question to the actual query. SQL was not written to make
querying easy from other applications. In order to query a database
from an application, the application needs to build the SQL query
programmatically at run time, which means that all errors in the SQL
query string are also going to be discovered at run time.</p>
<h3 id="an-impedance-mismatch">An Impedance Mismatch</h3>
<p>Compiled languages offer an enormous advantage over interpreted
languages in that you can be confident that, if the application
compiles, then it does not contain any syntax errors. This assurance
removes an entire class of errors that exist in pure scripting
languages. Yet, by having an application generate SQL you are
re-introducing the possibility of a run time syntax
error. Furthermore, the errors which do get introduced are almost
always related to the construction of the SQL query rather than actual
column names or keywords in the query. Meaning the column names and
keywords are not as likely to be the source of syntax errors as they
don&rsquo;t normally change based on the user request. For example, an
application which allows the searching of available flights is less
likely to return different a type of data depending on the destination
city. You may get back more or less result, but it will usually be the
same basic set of information. Syntax errors around the column names
and keywords are often found through basic testing and fixed.</p>
<p>The more common (and harder to find) syntax errors are introduced in
the construction of the query itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you remember a space after the &lsquo;SELECT&rsquo; and &lsquo;FROM&rsquo; keywords?</li>
<li>Did you join your select fields with a comma, but remember to not
include a comma after the last one?</li>
<li>If this is the first filter then we need to add the &lsquo;WHERE&rsquo; keyword,
but if this is the second one we need to add the &lsquo;AND&rsquo; keyword, and
don&rsquo;t forget about the parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of syntax errors are often introduced based on the users
search criteria and can be significantly more difficult to find with
basic testing due to the sheer number of permutations.  This is the
real advantage of using a helper library like Hibernate Criteria
Builder. They provide an assurance that if you use their libraries,
the generated SQL will be free of <em>construction syntax errors</em>. This
assurance is most often achieved through massive test coverage and a
responsive development team which quickly patches any errors that are
found. It would be safe to say that in the 45+ years since the
introduction of SQL, millions of lines of code have been written in
various languages, all attempting to work around this same basic
problem. It&rsquo;s a huge waste of intellectual effort for what is
essentially a self inflicted problem.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h3>
<p>SQL and similar English based DSLs (domain specific languages) are
immensely powerful for building complex queries quickly.  As an end
user, nothing is more frustrating than trying to build a complex
search criteria through a form based UI.  First enter the subject,
then select the predicate, then enter the object, then click the
plus sign to add another filter, rinse and repeat.  This becomes
incredibly tedious very quickly and makes building complex groupings
all but impossible.</p>
<p>This is where an English based DSL really shines.  It allows a
seasoned user to rapidly create complex queries as they are doing it
interactively and have to do minimum mapping from what they are trying
to search for to the actual query they are running (just as SQL was
initially designed for).  But that is where the DSL should remain, as
a tool for the <em>end user</em>. Do not just create an API which takes the
DSL directly as, at best, you will be recreating the same impedance
mismatch and likely forcing your users to create the same set of
&ldquo;builder&rdquo; libraries.</p>
<p>Instead, define a flexible structure which can be used to describe a
query. JSON, XML or even one of the compressed protocols like Thrift
or Flatbuffers could work. Users can then create their query
programmatically and completely remove the risk of introducing a
construction based error because they forgot a space or included a
comma at the wrong location.  Your API can either accept this
structure directly for querying, or you can split it up and have
different endpoints accept different categories of queries based on
the structure of the return type.  Either way, creating a well defined
structure programmatically is straight forward and can easily be
supported from a multitude of languages.</p>
<p>As for your UI, you are going to have to create a parser for your DSL
anyhow which is going to build an intermediary representation of your
query.  If you merge your intermediary representation with your defined
query structure it should be trivial to show the user what they would
need to send to the API in order to reproduce their query in the API.</p>
<p>In this scenario your query language can continue to evolve separate
from your query structure.  You can even support other English based
DSLs as long as they can all generate the same query structure.  But
what ever you do, keep the two domains separate.  SQL is a terrible API.</p>
