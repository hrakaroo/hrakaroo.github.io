    <div class="article-style">
      <p><img src="./Hood.jpg" alt="Mt. Hood"></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In March 2022 I was accepted into the <a href="https://mazamas.org/BCEP/">Mazamas
BCEP</a> program where I learned basic rock
and snow climbing skills. This was a fantastic experience and I highly
recommend the program if you are in the Northwest and are at all
interested in hiking and climbing. Once the program completed I signed
up to join the Mt. Hood Climb scheduled for May 8, 2022 (mothers day),
which was eventually pushed back to the following Wednesday (May 11th)
due to weather conditions. There were a total of nine people
(including the climb leaders) in the climbing group.</p>
<h2 id="the-day-before">The day before</h2>
<p>The day before the climb I drove up to Timberline Lodge and parked in
the lower parking lot that allows climbers to camp/park overnight. In
the weeks before the climb I had built a flat &ldquo;bed&rdquo; in the back of my
Honda Pilot so I could put a sleeping pad down and stretch out.</p>
<p><img src="./HondaPilot.jpg" alt="honda pilot"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <em>really</em> good idea to get to the parking lot the night before
and start to acclimate to the altitude. Timberline lodge is at around
6,000 ft of elevation and the top of Mt. Hood is 11,249 so the more
time you have to acclimate the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six of the nine people from our group opted to show up the night
before with three people driving up the morning of the climb.
Initially we were planning to start our climb at 1am the next morning,
but due to temperatures being lower than expected we were able to push
our start time back to 2pm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the temperature heats up it can cause the ice and snow to soften
creating dangerous climbing conditions as rocks and ice are more
likely to break away and fall on you.  Additionally, warmer
temperatures weaken the structure of snow bridges over crevasses which
increases risk.  Ideally you want to climb when everything is frozen
solid and stable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after rechecking my pack several times I finally went to sleep
around 8pm.</p>
<h2 id="the-day-of">The day of</h2>
<h3 id="getting-ready">Getting Ready</h3>
<p>For a start time of 2am I should ideally wake up at 1am to begin
getting ready, but due to nerves I woke up closer to 12am and was
unable to fall back asleep.  So at 12:30am I gave up trying and
started getting ready for the climb. The day before I had prepared
oatmeal in a thermos with hot water which I had for breakfast and then
started to get my gear on.</p>
<p>In addition to everything in my pack, I was also carrying one of the
climbing ropes we were bringing in case we needed it going over the
bergschrund, which added around 15 lbs to my pack. (I was also carring
the fuel for the stove we were required to bring but it only added a
nominal amount of weight.)</p>
<h3 id="starting-the-climb">Starting the climb</h3>
<p>Just before 2am we started off. The night was amazingly clear but
<em>exceedingly cold</em>. As we were hiking up we could see the headlights
from other climbers further up the mountain who had left earlier.</p>
<p>The first part of the climb takes you to the top of the Palmer Lift
and the route you take is along the &ldquo;road&rdquo; the snowcats create when
coming back after grooming the ski slope. So the snow is pretty
compacted and you can climb it easily in just your mountaineering
boots and without crampons. (Crampons are great, but they are heavy,
increase the likelihood of tripping, and generally slow you down.)</p>
<p><img src="./HoodNight.jpg" alt="hood1"></p>
<h3 id="silcox-hut">Silcox Hut</h3>
<p>At approximately 3am we reached Silcox Hut and two things had already
happened.  First, two people decided to drop out of the climb as they
were not feeling up to it.  (It should be noted that both of these
people were from the group that decided to drive up the morning of the
climb so they did not have the extra six plus hours to acclimate to
the altitude.)</p>
<p>Secondly, my water was starting to freeze. I had made the mistake of
using a bladder for my water with an attached hose for drinking. This
was the same setup I had used on multiple hikes and ski trips so I
thought that as long as, after taking a drink, I blew air into my hose
I could keep it mostly thawed. The problem was that the nozzle had
collected water and was mostly frozen solid. After a lot of work I
managed to get it somewhat unclogged and had, what would turn out to
be, my last sip of water until after I was off the summit. In
retrospect this was a <em>huge</em> and possibly dangerous mistake on my part
and I should have carried backup water in my pack.</p>
<p>Somewhere between Silcox Hut and the top of the Palmer lift we started
to get whiffs of the fumaroles on Mt. Hood which smells strong of
sulfur.</p>
<h3 id="top-of-palmer">Top of Palmer</h3>
<p>At 4:40am we reached the top of the Palmer lift. The sun was starting
to come up a bit but it was still <em>really</em> cold.</p>
<p><img src="./Palmer1.jpg" alt="Palmer 1"></p>
<p>For the climb up to the Hogsback (and summit beyond) we would be in
deep snow and no longer on a groomed trail so we needed our crampons,
helmets and ice axes.</p>
<p><img src="./Palmer2.jpg" alt="Palmer 2"></p>
<p>I was also able to switch off carrying the climbing rope to another
climber so for the rest of the time my pack was 15 lbs lighter which
made a considerable difference.</p>
<p>We had brought snowshoes for the climb, but after looking at the steps
already dug for us by the previous climbers, we decided to stash our
snowshoes near Palmer and go on without them.</p>
<p><img src="./AbovePalmer1.jpg" alt="Above Palmer 1"></p>
<p><img src="./AbovePalmer2.jpg" alt="Above Palmer 2"></p>
<p>You can see the shadow of the mountain on the landscape below.</p>
<p><img src="./AbovePalmer3.jpg" alt="Above Palmer 3"></p>
<p><img src="./Hogsback1.jpg" alt="Climb to Hogsback1"></p>
<p><img src="./Hogsback2.jpg" alt="Climb to Hogsback2"></p>
<p><img src="./Hogsback3.jpg" alt="Hogsback1"></p>
<h3 id="hogsback">Hogsback</h3>
<p>Once we reached the Hogsback we were able to see the different routes
to the summit.  The Pearly Gates looked safe enough and the
bergschrund was sufficiently covered that we felt comfortable climbing
to the summit without ropes. This allowed us to stash our ropes and
harnesses which removed a considerable amount of weight from our
packs.</p>
<p><img src="./Pearly1.jpg" alt="Path to Pearly Gates1"></p>
<h3 id="fumaroles">Fumaroles</h3>
<p>At the Hogsback you can also see the fumaroles to either side of the
path to the Pearly Gates. It&rsquo;s important to watch your step near them
because while they are warm, it&rsquo;s really the lack of oxygen that will
kill you before the heat will. That said, they are rather stunning in
the snow.</p>
<p><img src="./Fumaroles1.jpg" alt="Fumaroles 1">
<img src="./Fumaroles2.jpg" alt="Fumaroles 2"></p>
<h3 id="pearly-gates">Pearly Gates</h3>
<p>We were forced to wait a bit at Hogsback as there were a lot of people
trying to get through the Pearly Gates and the section right before
the Gates themselves is the bergschrund, which you want to pass over
as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><img src="./Pearly2.jpg" alt="Path to Pearly Gates1">
<img src="./Pearly3.jpg" alt="Path to Pearly Gates1"></p>
<p>Going through the Pearly Gates was one of the more surreal experiences
of the entire climb. First, the angle is rather steep so a lot of the
climb is on your hands and feet. The climbers before us had already
cut steps into the snow so it isn&rsquo;t particularly hard, but it is slow
going and some areas are only wide enough for two people (one going up
and one going down) so you are forced to go as slow as the person
ahead of you is going. Secondly, the natural ice sculptures that have
been created from the snow and wind are stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="./Pearly4.jpg" alt="Path to Pearly Gates1">
<img src="./Pearly5.jpg" alt="Path to Pearly Gates1"></p>
<p>Of course, the entire time I was climbing up through the Pearly Gates
I had it in the back of my mind that I would shortly be having to
climb down this as well.</p>
<h3 id="the-summit">The Summit</h3>
<p>Once you pass through the Pearly Gates the top of the mountain
actually levels off a bit and the summit is mostly flat with only
about a 10-15% incline.</p>
<p><img src="./Summit1.jpg" alt="Summit 1">
<img src="./Summit2.jpg" alt="Summit 2">
<img src="./Summit3.jpg" alt="Summit 3">
<img src="./Summit4.jpg" alt="Summit 4"></p>
<p>The view from the top is nothing short of breathtaking.  The sun was
out and we could see for miles.  It was, however, very cold and we
still had to down climb through the Pearly Gates.</p>
<h3 id="the-climb-down">The climb down</h3>
<p>While climbing up through the Pearly Gates you can plan out where you
are going to step, but the way back down requires a lot more trust.
This is where having spikes on the front of your crampons and
mountaineering boots really pays off. For most steps I would kick my
foot into the snow a couple of times until I had created a slight
indentation and then use the spikes to hold the majority of my weight.
My mountaineering boots had a full shank so as long as my toes were
secure I could stand up securely with the majority of my foot
suspended by just my toes.</p>
<p>Initially this was hard for me to relax into, but after a while I
really started to trust my equipment and the climb down became a lot
easier.</p>
<h3 id="plunge-stepping-down-to-palmer">Plunge stepping down to Palmer</h3>
<p><img src="./Down.jpg" alt="Down"></p>
<p>Once we were back at the Hogsback my water tube finally thawed
enough that I was able to get a drink. After that we collected the
ropes and harnesses we had stashed and headed down to Palmer.</p>
<p>We started out on the trail we had taken getting to the Hogsback, but
quickly drifted off and were mostly plunge stepping down to Palmer.
Some of the folks in our group tried glissading down, but the snow was
pretty deep which made for slow going.</p>
<h3 id="glissading">Glissading</h3>
<p>At Palmer we collected the snow shoes we had stashed and got back onto
the groomed snowcat trail. We also quickly discovered that while
glissading in the deep snow was difficult, glissading on the groomed
snowcat trail was really easy. I had brought with me some medium gauge
plastic that worked okay as a sled as I was able to glissade for
probably 75% of the way from Palmer back to Timberline.</p>
<h3 id="back-at-the-car">Back at the car</h3>
<p>Finally back at the car we packed up our gear and drove into Welches to
have lunch.  After lunch I went into the parking lot, got into my sleeping
bag and took a four hour nap before finally driving home.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="1010-would-do-it-again">10/10 would do it again</h3>
<p>I had a fantastic time overall, the weather was near perfect and the
climbing was excellent. The ice sculptures near the summit are
unworldly and something that you really need to see in person to
believe.  It was also amazing standing at the highest point in all of
Oregon and being able to see for miles around you.</p>
<h3 id="the-cold-was-no-joke">The cold was no joke</h3>
<p>I think overall I underestimated how cold it was going to get. In
addition to my water tube freezing and leaving me without water for
the majority of the climb, my fingers and toes also suffered.  I
suspect that I have Raynaud&rsquo;s disease which causes my body to abandon
my fingers and toes pretty quickly when I get cold.  Although I was
wearing gloves and glove liners, my fingers still became very cold and
numb.  Plus, putting on my crampons, opening my backpack and even just
getting my snack bag opened required me to take off at least my outer
glove layer which didn&rsquo;t help. I also started to lose feeling in my
toes around Palmer and continued to lose more feeling in my feet for
the rest of the climb.</p>
<p>Normally once I warm up the feeling comes back into my fingers and
toes pretty quickly, but not this time. For at least the first week
after the climb (and some of the next) I still had loss of feeling in
my toes, thumbs and forefingers.  This was unnerving and at the time I
wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if I would ever regain feeling.  Eventually, slowly,
the feeling did come back and now I&rsquo;m back to normal, but it&rsquo;s not
something I really want to repeat.</p>
<p>For next time I have purchased some battery powered socks and mittens
that I&rsquo;m hoping will keep me warmer.  Plus, I&rsquo;m going to be taking some
of those chemical hand warmers with me as well.</p>
<h3 id="gear">Gear</h3>
<p>With the exception of my water bladder/tube the rest of my gear for the
trip worked out really well and I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. A second
ice axe would probably have been useful but I didn&rsquo;t feel unsafe without
one.  The only real modification that I will be making for next time
is creating a glissading sled with thicker plastic so it holds up better
for the ride down.</p>
