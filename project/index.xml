      <title>One Seat Open</title>
      <link>https://hrakaroo.com/project/one-seat-open/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One Seat Open, an invitation system for limited seating events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project primarily came from a personal frustration in hosting my
own game nights.  Most invitation systems I researched were open ended
(no wait list support) or were so chock full of ads that I could
barely navigate them.  At the same time I was also looking for a
project with which to learn front end development as I have been
mostly focused on backed development. So this seemed like a perfect
opportunity to build my own service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After researching several frontend frameworks I eventually settled on
Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin for several reasons.  Vue.js was
established enough to have good tutorials, training videos and a
robust presence on Stack Overflow for questions.  It also had an easy
ramp up and it didn&amp;rsquo;t originate from Facebook.  (Petty, I know, but I
have a personal distain of Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;status&#34;&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2019 I finished the initial version of and started
to host a couple of game nights on the system.  It was working pretty
well but then the pandemic hit and I halted my home games, which halted
my motiviation for working on the service.  So it sat mostly idle until
recently when I decided to start working on it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wrote this service in Kotlin while I was doing a lot of
Kotlin development at work. After changing companies I switched to
primarily using Go for my work development and haven&amp;rsquo;t really done
a lot of Kotlin development since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still really like the Kotlin language, but it is much easier to
develop in a language you are currently using. Plus, I often use my
personal projects as a way to explore different solutions to technical
challenges at work, so aligning the two can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to rewrite the project completely in
Go with Vue3, but still using the Vuetify plugin. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided
to keep this code base closed source for the time being.  I&amp;rsquo;m not 100%
sure yet what I want to do with  it once/if I finish it and want to
keep my options open for now.&lt;/p&gt;
