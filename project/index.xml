      <title>One Seat Open</title>
      <link>/project/one-seat-open/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oneseatopen.com&#34;&gt;One Seat Open&lt;/a&gt;, an invitation system for
limited seating events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project primarily came from a personal frustration in hosting my
own game nights.  Most invitation systems I researched were open ended
(no wait list support) or were so chock full of ads that I could
barely navigate them.  At the same time I was also looking for a
project with which to learn front end development as I have been
mostly focused backed development. So this seemed like a perfect
opportunity to build my own service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After researching several frontend frameworks I eventually settled on
Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin for several reasons.  Vue.js was
established enough to have good tutorials, training videos and a
robust presence on Stack Overflow for questions.  It also had an easy
ramp up and it didn&#39;t originate from Facebook.  (Petty, I know, but I
have a personal distain of Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;status&#34;&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2019 I launched the site and moved hosting my game
night to the system so I can start &amp;ldquo;eating my own dog food.&amp;rdquo;  I still
have several large features I want to add before I really start
start trying to push it more globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I&#39;m keeping it closed source, but free to use.  If the service
proves popular I will likely be forced to add either a for-pay section
or ads to cover my hosting fees, but otherwise I have no immediate
commercialization plans for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
