      <description>One Seat Open is an invitation system for limited seating events.
History This project primarily came from a personal frustration in hosting my own game nights. Most invitation systems at the time were open ended (no wait list support) or were so chock full of ads that I could barely navigate them. At the same time I was also looking for a project with which to learn front end development as I have been mostly focused backed development.</description>
