    <p><a href="https://www.oneseatopen.com">One Seat Open</a> is an invitation system for
limited seating events.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This project primarily came from a personal frustration in hosting my
own game nights.  Most invitation systems at the time were open ended
(no wait list support) or were so chock full of ads that I could
barely navigate them.  At the same time I was also looking for a
project with which to learn front end development as I have been
mostly focused backed development. So this seemed like a perfect
opportunity to build my own service and also try out hosting a project
on heroku and authentication through auth0.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>After researching several frontend frameworks I eventually settled on
Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin for a variety of reasons.  Vue.js was
established enough to have good tutorials, training videos and a
robust presence on Stack Overflow for questions.  It also had an easy
ramp up and it didn't originate from Facebook.  (Petty, I know, but I
have a personal distain of Facebook).</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>In November of 2019 I launched the site and moved hosting my game
night to the system so I can start &ldquo;eating my own dog food.&rdquo;  I still
have several large features I want to add before I really start
start trying to push it more globally.</p>
<p>For now I'm keeping it closed source, but free to use.  If the service
proves popular I will likely be forced to add either a for-pay section
or ads to cover my hosting fees, but otherwise I have no immediate
commercialization plans for the service.</p>
