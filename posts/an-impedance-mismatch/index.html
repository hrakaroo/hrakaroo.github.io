<h3 id="a-long-time-ago">A long time ago&hellip;</h3>
<p>In 1974 the first relational database was created and along with it a
new user interface language was developed to make it easy to query the
data. This language (or rather sublanguage) was called Structured
English Query Language or SEQUEL. SEQUEL would later evolved into SQL
and become the preeminent language for querying relational
databases. In the 45+ years since it’s introduction SQL has evolved
slightly but it is still largely similar to the version introduced in
the 70s. What has changed during that time is how we interact with the
database. Today, SQL is used significantly more by applications
querying the database than by end users. This usage pattern has
created its own ecosystem of utilities and libraries which help
applications build SQL queries.  One of the more popular libraries for
building SQL queries in Java is Hibernate’s Criteria Builder
(<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/entitymanager/3.5/reference/en/html/querycriteria.html">https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/entitymanager/3.5/reference/en/html/querycriteria.html</a>)
which uses an annotation pre-processor and a builder pattern to
facilitate building SQL queries.  (Java’s Persistence API was based
heavily on Hibernate’s Criteria Builder). But, at the end of the day
the builder still generates a basic SQL string which is sent to the
target database, parsed and then executed. Hibernate is just one
example, but there are hundreds of other libraries that exist across
various languages which all seek to provide the same basic
functionality. To provide an API which abstracts away the actual
building of an SQL query.</p>
<p>So why do these all exist? Is an SQL query so complicated to construct
that we need libraries and utilities to help us? In general, no, most
SQL queries are relatively straightforward. The real problem is that
SQL was designed for humans and not computers. The inclusion of the
word ‘English’ in the original name was not by chance, SQL was
intended to be similar enough to English that it would be self
descriptive and would only require minimal transformation from the
spoken question to the actual query.  SQL was not written to make
querying easy from other applications.  In order to query a database
from an application, the application needs to build the SQL query
string at run time programmatically, which means that all errors in
the SQL query string are also going to be discovered at run time.</p>
<h3 id="an-impedence-mismatch">An Impedence Mismatch</h3>
<p>Compiled languages offer a huge edge over interpreted ones in that you
can be confident that if the application compiles it does not contain
any syntax errors. This assurance removes an entire class of errors
that exist in pure scripting languages. Yet, by having an application
generate SQL you are re-introducing the possibility of a run time
syntax error. Furthermore, the errors which do get introduced are
almost always related to the construction of the SQL query rather than
actual column names or keywords in the query. Meaning the column names
and keywords are not as likely to be the source of syntax errors as
they don’t normally change based on the user request. For example, an
application which allows the searching of available flights is less
likely to return different types of data depending on the destination
city. You may get back more or less result, but it will usually be the
same basic set of information. Syntax errors around the column names
and keywords are often found through basic testing and fixed.</p>
<p>The more common (and harder to find) syntax errors are introduced in
the construction of the query itself. &ldquo;Did you remember a space after
the SELECT and FROM keywords?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you join your select fields with a
comma, but remember to not include a comma after the last one?&rdquo; &ldquo;If
this is the first filter then we need to add the &lsquo;WHERE&rsquo; keyword, but
if this is the second one we need to add the &lsquo;AND&rsquo; keyword, and don’t
forget about the parentheses.&rdquo; These types of syntax errors are often
introduced based on the users search criteria and can be significantly
more difficult to find with basic testing due to the sheer number of
permutations.  This type of syntax error is what helper libraries like
Hibernate Criteria Builder are attempting to solve. They provide an
assurance that if you use their libraries, the generated SQL will be
free of construction syntax errors. This assurance is most often
achieved through massive test coverage and a responsive development
team which quickly patches any errors that are found. It would be safe
to say that in the 45+ years since the introduction of SQL, millions
of lines of code have been written in various languages, all
attempting to work around this same basic problem. It’s a huge waste
of intellectual effort for what is essentially a self inflicted
problem.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here.</h3>
<p>SQL and similar English based DSLs (domain specific languages) are
great, but their usage should be limited to what it was initially
created for, end users.  As an end user, nothing is more frustrating
than trying to build a complex search criteria through a UI.  &ldquo;Enter
your subject, select your predicate, then enter your object.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Click
the plus sign to add more conditions.&rdquo; In addition to being tedious it
becomes nearly impossible to support grouping of conditions. This is
where an English based DSL really shines.  It allows a seasoned user
to rapidly create complex queries as they are doing it interactively
and have to do minimum mapping from what they are trying to search for
to the actual query they are running (just as SQL was initialy
designed for).  But that is where the DSL should remain.  Do not
support it directly through your API as, at best, you will be
recreating the same impedance mismatch and likely forcing your users
to create the same set of &ldquo;builder&rdquo; libraries.</p>
<p>For your API you should define a flexible structure which can be used
to describe a query. JSON would be a good option, but XML or one of
the compressed protocols like Thrift or Flatbuffers would also
work. Users can then create their query programmatically and
completely remove the risk of introducing an error because they forgot
a space or included a comma at the wrong location.  Your API can
either accept this structure directly for querying, or you can split
it up and have different endpoints accept different categories of
queries based on the structure of the return type.  Either way,
creating a well defined structure programmatically is straight forward
and can easily be supported from a multitude of languages.</p>
<p>As for your UI, you are going to have to create a parser for your DSL
anyhow which is going to build an intermediary representation of your
query.  So just have the intermediary representation be your defined
query structure.  Now, when your user does create a query in your UI
that they want to execute through your API, give them an option to see
the parsed structure so they know exactly what they need to code to.</p>
<p>In this scenario your query language can continue to evolve separate
from your query structure.  You can even support other English based
DSLs as long as they can all generate the same query structure.  But
what ever you do, keep the two domains separate.  SQL a terrible API.</p>
